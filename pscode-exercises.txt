// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num % 2 == 0 
    Even
else
    odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

if num_numbers == 5

//average
    calculate sum
    average = sum / 5
    print average

//max min
    if x1 > x2
        x1 > x3
            x1 > x4
                x1 > x5
                    print max = x1
                else
                    print min = x1
//repeat for 2-5

else 
    exit
